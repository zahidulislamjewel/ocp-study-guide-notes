# OCP EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

# Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java

- Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection.
- Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers.
- Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation, and create immutable objects. Use local variable type inference.
- Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed types as well as record classes. 
- Override methods, including that of the Object class. 
- Implement polymorphism and differentiate between object type and reference type. 
- Perform reference type casting, identify object types using the instanceof operator, and pattern matching with the instanceof operator and the switch construct.
- Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods.
- Create and use enum types with fields, methods, and constructors.
